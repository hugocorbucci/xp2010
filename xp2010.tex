\section{Introduction}

Typical Open Source (OS) projects (the scope of of OS project will be
narrowed according to Section \ref{sec:scope}) usually receive
the collaboration of many geographically distant people
\cite{report:dempsey1999}. At first glance, this argument could
indicate that such projects are not candidates for the use of agile
methods since some basic values seem to be missing. In this case, the
distance and diversity separating developers deteriorates
communication, a very important value within agile methods. However,
it is common to identify some principles presented by the agile
manifesto \cite{url:agilemanifesto} on many open source software
projects. Being ready for changes, working with continuous feedback,
delivering real features, respecting collaborators and users and
facing challenges are expected attitudes from agile developers
naturally found in the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
communities\cite{gabriel2005}.

During a workshop \cite{conference:oopsla2007} held at OOPSLA 2007
cellebrating 20 years from the publication of ``No Silver Bullets''
\cite{brooks1987}, agile methods and OS software development were
mentioned as two failed silver bullets having both brought great
benefit to the software community. During the same workshop the
question was raised whether the use of several failed silver bullets
simultaneously could not raise production levels by an order of
magnitude. This work is an attempt to suggest one of those merges to
partially tackle software development problems.

\section{Scopes}
\label{sec:scope}

The FOSS environment as well as the agile both comprehend such a wide
variety of projects, people and contexts that it is very hard to cover
all of them. Therefore it is necessary to first define which part of
each community will be analysed in this work.
\\

Thoughout this work, any software engineering method that follows the
principles of the agile manifesto \cite{url:agilemanifesto} will be
considered and treated as an agile method. Focus will be given on the
most known methods, such as eXtreme Programming (XP) \cite{XP2002},
Scrum \cite{schwaber2004} and the Crystal family
\cite{cockburn2002}. Closely related ideas will also be mentioned from
the wider Lean philosophy \cite{ohno1998} and its application to
software development \cite{poppendieck2005}.
\\

The terms ``open source software'' and ``free software'' will be
considered the same in this work although they have some differences
in their specific contexts \cite[Ch. 1, Free Versus Open
source]{fogel2005}. Projects will be called to be open source (or
free) if their source code is available and modifiable by anyone with
the required technical knowledge, without prior consent from the
original author and without any charge.

OS projects essentially controlled by a single company fall out of the
scope of this work. The reason for such reduction of scope is that
projects controlled by companies, whether they have a public source
code and accept external collaboration or not, can be run with any
software engineering method established in the company since it can be
enforced to the employees of this company.

Considering this scope, it is important to characterize the people
involved in such kind of projects. In 2002, the FLOSS Project
\cite{url:flossproject} published a report about a survey they
conducted regarding FOSS contributors. Their collected data
\cite{url:flossdata} shows that 78.77\% of the contributors are
employed or self-employed (question 42) and that only 50.82\% of the
OS community are software developers while 24.76\% do not earn their
main income with software development (question 10).  In addition to
those results, the survey presents the fact that 78.78\% of the
collaborators consider their OS tasks more joyful (question 22.2) than
their regular activities and 42.3\% also consider them better
organized (question 22.4). As an outcome of those results, we could
say that OS contributors perceive their activities both pleasurable
and effective.

Another survey \cite{reis2003} points out that 74\% of open source
projects have teams with up to 5 people and 62\% of the contributors
work with each other over the Internet and have never met physically.

Considering such characterization of the FOSS community, the next
section presents what is the relation between such development
environment with the ideas and guidelines of agile methodologies.

\section{How closely related are Open source and Agile?}
\label{sec:relation}

In Martin Fowler's first version of ``The New Methodology''
\cite{url:fowler2000orig}, he included open source software
development as part of the new methodology of software development
along with now well known Agile methods. He decided to remove it from
the final article because the FOSS environment is so big and spread
that any attempt to characterize the development process would
undoutebly fail on a given environment.

Aftewards, in 2002, Warsta \cite{warsta2002} published a review about
agile software development methods including and discussing OSS as an
agile method.  However, he stresses that FOSS development is not a
precise method and evolves differently for each project. Indeed, Eric
Raymond's description of the development process from ``The Cathedral
and the Bazaar'' \cite{raymond1999} is closer to an experience report
than to the description of a process with guidelines and
practices. Nevertheless, Raymond's text presents several actions that
could be related to the agile manifesto \cite{url:agilemanifesto} and
are common in other FOSS projects.

FOSS communities are, by definition, a group of people gathered around
a FOSS project. A working and useful software project attracts
individuals to collaborate to evolve the
software\cite{crowston2002}. It is the people's interactions that will
define the development process, tools and even the goals of the
software. FOSS projects that do not evolve to fit the needs of its
community are abandoned in a highly competitive environment where the
best (in certain criteria) gains adopters in a thin line between
success and oblivion.

From such aspects, FOSS project share a lot in common with the values
presented by agile methods. The practices are also quite similar. Eric
Raymond quotes Linus Torvalds about two specific development policy
for the Linux Kernel.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[7.] Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
\item[8.] Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base,
  almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will
  be obvious to someone.
\end{enumerate}

The first policy hints for an iterative and short development process
with frequent feedback input. The second one points to a large amount
of test done frequently. Those ideas are core principles for agile
methods and largely applied to several sucessful FOSS projects.

We can, therefore, state that the FOSS community have a culture that
is similar to the one of the agile community. Given that there is such
proximity between agile methods and FOSS development, it must not be
forgotten that the environment in which each solution outstand are
quite different.

Open source software is stronger when it comes to products that
``scratch a developer's itch'' \cite{fitzgerald2000}, i.e. a product
in which the own developer can be the user. Such product evolve across
the Internet gathering volunteers interested in such development by
releasing versions of the software frequently.

Agile methods come from industry consultants with focus on business
problems and customer satisfaction through frequent high quality
releases. To achieve such goal, an ideal agile team needs motivated
competent people closely gathered with freedom to improve their
environment and process to enable what Cockburn calls osmotic
communication \cite{cockburn2004}.

The most critical discrepeancy is the one regarding
communication. Agile methods stress out that many software development
problems come from the lack of high quality communication and the best way to mitigate it
is to keep people close and in constant contact. Open source
software are inherently distributed and frequently run by people that
only meet through the Internet. Could there be a way to unite the
strenght of both communities and improve development in distributed
environments with changing requirements?

In order to evaluate this possibility, we decided to elaborate two
surveys. The next section describes how the surveys were elaborated
and what information were expected to be collected.

\section{Surveys}
\label{sec:surveys}

Since the motivation to write was to understand if the agile community
and the FOSS community could share more principles and practices, one
survey was directed to agile practionners while the other was aimed to
FOSS contributors.  Each survey intended to characterize the answering
public, was available on the Internet and was spread in channels
common to the target communities.

The next subsection presents the survey created for the FLOSS
community while the following one shows the one aimed to the agile
community.

\subsection{To the FLOSS community}
\label{subsec:floss-survey}

For both surveys, part of the goal was to identify which part of the
community answered the question and how representatives they were for
their community. Therefore, the first set of questions were pretty
similar between both surveys and inquired the participants about their
year of birth and country of residence. Both surveys also tried to
evaluate the experience of the participants in their community. For
the FLOSS community that translated to the amount of project with
which the participant had contributed with as well the first year of
contribution.

This last question as well as the following ones were only displayed
if the participant had contributed to at least one FLOSS project since
most questions would be meaningless otherwise. In order to narrow the
environment that the participants would have to evaluate as well as
their experience in such project, they were asked the name of the main
project as well as their role in the project.

To understand how the project ensure communication between its
collaborators, the participants were asked how big was the project
team and, if there was a team (not a single person team) what was the
communication channel used to communicate among them. The survey also
asked the participant to evaluate the quality of the communication
through that channel. The survey also included a similar question
regarding the communication channel with the users of project and its
evaluated quality.

At last, the survey inquired the participants about which of 8 tools
did the project already used and how they would classify the
usefulness of those tools to mitigate their problem with the project's
development.

A paper version of the survey can be found in Appendix
\ref{appendix:a}\footnote{The online address of the survey was ommited
  according to the submission rules}.
% while the online version can be accessed at {\tt
%   http://www.ime.usp.br/~corbucci/floss-survey}.
The survey was announced via twitter\footnote{http://twitter.com} by
the authors and received the support of
GitHub\footnote{http://github.com} who asked their users to fill in
the survey.

The survey was also sent to other FLOSS project hosting systems such
as SourceForge.net, LaunchPad.net, CodeHaus, Google Code but none
answered the request or provided any sort of answers.  It was also
published in a few blogs related to the FLOSS community and mailing
lists for the Python community as well other international mailing
lists.

\subsection{To the Agile community}
\label{subsec:agile-survey}

The beginning of the survey directed to the Agile community was very
similar to the one to the FLOSS community since its goal was to
collect data to characterize the participants.  After the first
questions regarding the residence country and the year of bird, the
agile survey inquired the participants about their agile experience
asking on how many agile projects they participated in and when was
their first agile project.

Similarly to the FLOSS survey, this last question as well as the
following were only displayed to participants that had been in at
least one of agile project. The survey kept on asking about the
participant's main role in the project and the size of the team
involved. The participant was then asked to inform the main
communication channel used to communicate with the client of that
project as well as the quality of communication on that channel.

Divergence from the FLOSS survey followed with a question inquiring if
the participant had any previous experience with applying agile
methods in a distributed environment. If so, the participant was asked
to describe the communication channel used in this distributed project
and its quality.

The participants were then asked to sort the 3 most critical problems
encountered in the agile environment in which they
participated. Afterwards the participant should sort the top 3 tools
(out of 8) that would help in a distributed agile environment.

Finally, the participants were asked if they were FLOSS contributors
and, if so, how agile they considered their FLOSS project and how
would they sort the problems and tools in that FLOSS environment.

The paper version of this version can be found in Appendix
\ref{appendix:b}\footnote{The online address of the survey was ommited
  according to the submission rules}
% while the online version can be found at {\tt
%   http://www.ime.usp.br/~corbucci/agile-survey}.
This survey was announced in mailing lists related to the subject as
well as blogs and twitter by various supporters. The authors also
seeked the support from the Agile Alliance but no answer was provided.

\section{Survey results}
\label{sec:results}

The surveys were ellaborated to be answered by the participants
through the Internet and used some dynamic contents to minimize the
amount of answers each participants should provide. Such work was
performed through Javascript but was not validated against older
browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 and 7. Trying to answer the
surveys using those browsers resulted in an invalid answer. This
unexpected error provided an extra information regarding the browser
used by each community.

The individual results of each survey provide interesting data by
themselves and are described in subsections \ref{subsec:floss-results}
and \ref{subsec:agile-results} for the FLOSS survey and the agile one
respectively. Subsection \ref{subsec:crossed-results} presents data crossed
between the two surveys.

\subsection{Individual results from the FLOSS community}
\label{subsec:floss-results}

The results for the FLOSS survey were collected between 2009/07/28 and
2009/11/01. The survey received 309 entries from which 3 were
duplicated data (same IP address and time entry) while 4 others were
invalid answers (caused by Javascript errors). This unexpected data
shows that aproximately 1\% of people who are connected with FLOSS
communities use a browser not compatible with the standarts.

Out of those 302 valid entries, 122 were answers in which the
participant never contributed to a FLOSS project but considered
herself as part of the FLOSS community. So only about 60\% of the
FLOSS community actually contributes with projects.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{floss-world.pdf}
    \caption{FLOSS answers in the world}

  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}

    \caption{Main income origin for FLOSS participants}
    \label{fig:floss-income}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The analysis was performed over the 180 answers left since they
provided more interesting data. Figure \ref{fig:floss-world}
represents the distribution of the answers around the globe. Figure
\ref{fig:floss-income} shows the main income origin of the
participants. The average age of the participants was 28 years old and
the average year of for the first FLOSS contribution was 2003. Figure
\ref{fig:floss-firstxp} shows that younger participants started
contributing earlier in their life than older participants which can
be explained by the increasing ease to get in touch with a computer in
the last years.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.9]{floss-firstxp.pdf}
  \caption{Age of first FLOSS contribution by year of birth}
  \label{fig:floss-firstxp}
\end{figure}
% TODO Melhorar gráfico de idades de contribuição inicial

About two thirds of the participants were project maintainers,
commiters or programmers. The last third was partitioned between other
roles as shows Figure \ref{fig:floss-roles}. Team sizes were also
fairly representative since only 6\% of the project were single person
team while 48\% were up to 5 team members. Figure
\ref{fig:floss-teams} shows those results and the reported team
sizes. It is interesting to notice that such profile is similar to the
one described by Reis \cite{reis2003} obtained in 2003.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{floss-roles.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of participant's roles}
    \label{fig:floss-roles}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{flushright}

      \caption{FLOSS projects reported team sizes}
      \label{fig:floss-teams}
    \end{flushright}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Regarding the main communication channels, it seems to have changed a
little since the FLOSS world research or Reis' one. The main
communication channels with the rest of the team are still mailing
lists (27\%) and Internet Relay Chat (IRC - 23\%). However the amount
of people using face to face communication within the team shows some
increase (now at 15\%). The quality of the communication in those
channels was fairly similar. Mailing lists were evaluated to be 44\%
effective against 52\% for IRC channels and 49\% for face to face.

When it comes to communication with the users, mailing lists were the
most used (32\%) followed by the website (18\%) and IRC channels,
emails and issue trackers (11\% each). When it comes to quality of
communication in such channels, IRC channels scores again once again
with 49\% effectiveness against 44\% for mailing lists, 37\% for
websites, 33\% for issue tracker and mere 23\% for emails.

For both environments, other communication channels were ommited since
there were too few answers to show any significant data.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{floss-tools.pdf}
  \caption{FLOSS answers regarding tools usefulness}
  \label{fig:floss-tools}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:floss-tools} shows the top three choices of most
useful tools within a FLOSS project. Automatic email/message on build
failure was considered the most useful tool by large followed by a
dynamic roadmap status from the issue tracking management system and
issue tracking management from repository commit logs.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.8]{floss-existingtools.pdf}
  \caption{Tool participants already use in their FLOSS project}
  \label{fig:floss-existingtools}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:floss-existingtools} shows that a reasonable amount of
project already have automatic email/message on build failure and
issue tracking management from repository commit logs.

However, we should be aware that Github features an issue tracking
management from repository commits while many other forges don't. And
since Github officially announced the survey, it is probable that many
of their users answered the survey.

\subsection{Individual results from the Agile community}
\label{subsec:agile-results}

The results for the survey directed to the agile community were
collected between 2009/10/01 and 2009/12/01. It received 204 answers
from which 9 were duplicate entries and 34 were invalid due to the use
of incompatible browsers. Such data shows us that about 18\% of the
participants still use browsers incompatible with Javascript
standarts. Sensibly more people than in the FLOSS community.

Out of those 161 valid answers, only 28 were from people that never
actually participanted in an agile project but considered themselves
as agile practioners. Another fairly different result from the FLOSS
community. The agile community seems to value ``hands on'' experience
much more than the FLOSS community.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{agile-world.pdf}
    \caption{Answers by region of the world}
    \label{fig:agile-world}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{agile-xp.pdf}
    \caption{Number of agile projects experience of the participants}
    \label{fig:agile-xp}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

However it is not a very deep experience since 51\% of the
participants were involved in at most 2 agile projects and only 23\%
had more than 5 agile projects experience. For the rest of the
analysis, participants without any agile experience will not be
counted since they provide little useful data.

For those who had some experience, most still only had a very recent
contact with agile projects. Figure \ref{fig:agile-distributed} shows
that the first experience with agile for most participants only
happened after 2006. We can also see that there is a fairly regular
amount of people with distributed agile experience regardless of the
year of first agile experience.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.55\linewidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.45]{agile-distributed.pdf}
    \caption{Distributed agile experience according to the year of the
      first agile experience}
    \label{fig:agile-distributed}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\linewidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.45]{agile-roles.pdf}
    \caption{Roles description in the agile community}
    \label{fig:agile-roles}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:agile-roles} shows that most participants considered
themselves programmers which contrasts with the variety of roles
accumulated in the FLOSS community. Such indication can be justified
by the low hierarchy suggested by some agile books.
% TODO Ref

When it comes to team sizes, smaller teams are obviously
prefered. Figure \ref{fig:agile-teams} shows the distribution of
average team sizes reported by the participants. From such results, it
is clear that a large majority of agile projects involve small teams.

\begin{figure}[htb]

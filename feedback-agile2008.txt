First reviewer's review:

         >>> Summary of the submission <<<

Authors lay out some evidence connecting agile methods and open source methods
together. They propose that this is a research arena, which should be targeted
and the authors are planning to conduct surveys on the topic area.

The short paper is addressing a timely topic. There are some necessary
improvements that you should for the next version.
1. You should have your paper checked by a native English speaker for improving
the readibility of your paper
2. You should identify few more references for your work as open source and
agil e methods have been discussed a few times. I am sorry for not being able
to pinpoint these references but I am convinced you are able to find them.
3. You have taken agile manifesto and values as your analytical framework. I
would have rather looked at papers written by Fitzgerald et al on open source
and use some more elaborate framework for your initial study.

Second reviewer's review:

         >>> Evaluation <<<

There is a lot that the agile and open source communities can learn from each
other. This paper hints at a few of the important opportunity areas areas but
does not lay them out in a clear and compelling way. This presentation needs to
be more systematic and detailed. It is not clear from the content which
community the authors are members of, if either as most of the content could be
based on a reading the provided references. As you state in the conclusion,
this is preliminary work. It is not sufficient yet to warrant publication but
after the planned workshops it ought to take on sufficient substance to be well
worth inclusion next year.

Third reviewer's review:

         >>> Summary of the submission <<<

The paper present a comparison between agile methods and open source
development. It discusses the principles of the agile manifesto in the opne
source development. It proposes missing points in agile methos and in open
souce development

         >>> Evaluation <<<

There is no novelty in the paper. No case study neither a report is presented.
The comparison is done on well known facts.
Some claims are strong like "Open Source projects usually receive the
collaboration of many deographically distant people who do not share any
organizational structure. At first this argument could indicate that such
projects are not candidates for ht euse of agile methods since some basic
values seems to be damnaged ..."

I would rather say that the successful open source project have a solid core
team well organized that manages the distributed development (think of
OpenOffice.org).
